# UnseenSpeciesCopia
Notes and materials for "Unseen Species Modelling Applied to Medieval Literature" workshop run by Elisabeth de Bruijn, Mike Kestemont, and Katarzyna Anna Kapitan at the seminar [Digital Approaches to Pre-Modern Texts and Manuscripts](https://www.chartes.psl.eu/gazette-chartiste/agenda/digital-approaches-pre-modern-texts-and-manuscripts) 10-12 June 2024, ENC-PSL in Paris. 

# Workshop Description
This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to estimating the diversity and loss of cultural artefacts, such as texts, or other object types—based on abundance data. Using medieval chivalric literature as a case study, the workshop introduces participants to the [Copia package](https://copia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html), a statistical toolkit developed by Mike Kestemont and Folgert Karsdorp. 

Copia was used - among other studies – in recent research on the survival of medieval chivalric and heroic literature, which will be the point of departure for this workshop.  

This workshop will:

– contextualise recent work in the field, including a critical discussion of methodological challenges;

– introduce the theoretical background behind Chao 1 and related richness estimators;

– offer a hands-on session to prepare data, run analyses using Copia, and interpret the results.

Participants will leave with a better understanding of how quantitative methods can contribute to historical and literary research, and how to apply these tools in their own work.

# Before the workshop:
In this workshop we will be using [Google Colab](​​https://colab.research.google.com/), which  is a free cloud service where you can create and share interactive notebooks with code, text, and visualization.  

If you have never used Colab before joining the workshop you should: 

- Create or log in to a Google account. 

- Follow at least the first 5 pages of [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab/index.htm), so you are familiar with the interface.

# The notebook 
You can find the notebook we used on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1utXSjOvRfVPV3H-xtAkWMr-KwoHs_7jk#scrollTo=D5k4B4HNoKSE)
